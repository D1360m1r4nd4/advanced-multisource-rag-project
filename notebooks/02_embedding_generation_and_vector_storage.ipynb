      "Text snippet: The Journey A Digital and Societal Lina Mohjazi, Bassant Selim, Mallik Abstract—While the fifth generation (5 G) is bringing an innovative fabric of breakthrough technologies, enabling smart factories, cities, and Internet-of-Things (Io T), the unprecedented strain on communication networks put by these applications, in terms of highly cognitive, agile architectures and the support of massive connectivity, energy efficiency, and extreme ultralow latency, is pushing 5 G to their limits. As such, the focus of academic and industrial efforts has shifted toward beyond 5 G (B 5 G) and the conceptualization of sixth generation (6 G) systems. This article discusses four main digital and societal use cases (UCs) that will drive the need to reconcile a new breed of network requirements. Based on this, we provide our vision of the fundamental architectural ingredients that will enable the promise of 6 G networks of bringing the unification of experiences across the digital, physical, and human worlds. We outline key disruptive technological paradigms that will support 6 G materialize a bouquet of unique expectations and redefine how we live and protect our planet. Finally, we adopt the recently envisaged ecosystem of the Internet-of-Musical Things (Io Mus T) to depict how the discussed UCs and technological paradigms may be exploited to realize this ecosystem. I. INTRODUCTION The rollout of fifth generation (5 G) wireless networks continues across the world and is bringing a technological breakthrough with respect to previous communication networks. Another substantial development is currently taking place through beyond 5 G (B 5 G) systems, where the focus is shifting from rate-centric enhanced mobile broadband (e MBB) services to ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and massive machine-type communications (m MTC). However, with the emerging revolutionary changes in individual and societal trends, it is arguable whether the capabilities of B 5 G systems will keep up the pace with the market demands of 2030, which is expected to witness a new breed of Internetof-Everything (Io E) services and radical advancements in human-machine interaction technologies [1]. Supporting cutting-edge future services not only necessitates delivering ultra-high reliability, extremely high data rates, and ultra-low latency, but also requires a new wave of network design, where computing, control, and communication are integrated into a network fabric that offers functionalities beyond communications, such as spatial and timing data. Researchers speculate that this grand vision will push 5 G L.Mohjaziand M.A.Imranarewiththe James Watt Schoolof Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G 12 8 QQ, UK. (e-mail:{Lina.

In this article, unlike existing works, which generally adopt a classic fashion in discussing 6 G systems requirements, challenges, and enabling technologies, we outline the vision of a 6 G-powered world by shedding light on what 6 G promises in Sec. II and overviewing the use cases (UC) that are expected to drive a digital and societal revolution in Sec. III. This is followed by introducing the paradigm shifts that formulate an evolved network architecture in Sec. IV. In Sec. V, we highlight the main 6 G technologies needed to realize the vision of a future connected cyber-physical world. Finally, Sec. VI focuses on the recently envisioned Io Mus T [2] to depict how the discussed UCs and technological paradigms can realize this ecosystem. II. WHAT DOES 6 G PROMISE? As the 5 G is gaining ground, the research community has shifted towards laying the fundamentals of next-generation (NG) systems. The 6 G vision is to create a seamless reality where the physical and digital worlds, so far separated, are converged. This will enable seamless movement in a cyberphysical continuum of a connected physical world of senses, actions, and experiences, and its programmable digital representation. With this futuristic converged reality, new ways to work remotely, meet new people, and experience foreign cultures and places will be made possible [3]. In addition, the vision of 6 G is to also create more humanfriendly, sustainable, and efficient communities. This requires networks that guarantee worldwide digital inclusion to support a wide range of elements, end-to-end (E 2 E) life-cycle tracking to reduce waste and automate recycling, resource-efficient connected agriculture, universal access to digital healthcare, etc. This requires embedded autonomous sensors and actuators, worldwide coverage with outstanding energy-, material-, and cost-efficiency, as well as a network platform with high availability and security [3]. III. DRIVING TRENDS AND USE CASES (UCS) The prospected 6 G promise stems from four main driving UCs, which both lay the foundation for numerous applications and set the technical requirements for future communication systems. These UCs are shown in Fig. 1 and are detailed in this section. Internet of t n e g i l ls ee t nn I d i h c ea t c M e n n o C Connected Sust Fig. 1. 6 G Use Cases. A. Internet-of-Senses (Io S): Any sense for anyone? The essence of the Io S, coined by Ericsson [4], is built on delivering multisensory experiences over the networks. This UC allows humans to have digital sensory immersive experiences that replicate or even augment what we experience in the physical world through visual, auditory, haptic, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli....\n",
