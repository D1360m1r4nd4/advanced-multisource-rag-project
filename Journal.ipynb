    "* Goal: Building a robust Q&A system.\n",
    "* Data Ingestion: The system must ingest data from at least three distinct sources, such as databases, websites, or PDFs.\n",
    "* Retrieval Mechanisms: It requires the use of multiple retrieval methods, including graph-based retrieval, vector search, or sentence window retrieval.\n",
    "* Processing Workflow: The system is designed to merge all the retrieved context and then rerank them before sending the information to the Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "* End Product: The final product should feature a web interface where a user can upload files (or point to data sources like a website, CSV, or database) and ask a natural language question, receiving a precise answer along with the source citations. \n",
    "* (optional feature) adding a metric that shows the latency and accuracy tradeoff, and including citations to boost credibility."

    "## Solution: JupyterLab instead of VS Code Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Given repeated issues with VS Code spawning multiple kernels per notebook despite configuration changes, decided to use **JupyterLab** instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why JupyterLab?\n",
    "- Native kernel management (one shared kernel across all notebooks)\n",
    "- No per-notebook spawning (unlike VS Code)\n",
    "- More stable for multi-notebook workflows\n",
    "- Better suited for RAG pipeline development (04 notebooks in sequence)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup & Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Start JupyterLab:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ~/advanced-multisource-rag-project\n",
    "./start_jupyter_lab.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The script will:\n",
    "1. Activate the `.venv`\n",
    "2. Kill any existing kernel processes (clean slate)\n",
    "3. Launch JupyterLab at `http://localhost:8888`\n",
    "4. All notebooks will share a **single kernel instance**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "1. Open notebook 01 in JupyterLab\n",
    "2. Run all cells (ingests PDF/CSV, chunks text)\n",
    "3. Switch to notebook 02 (same kernel — no hang)\n",
    "4. Run cells (generates embeddings, uploads to Qdrant)\n",
    "5. Switch to notebook 03 (continues with same kernel)\n",
    "6. Switch to notebook 04 (uses `query` and `context_for_llm` from 03)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits over VS Code:**\n",
    "- ✅ Single kernel for entire session\n",
    "- ✅ No \"Connecting to kernel...\" hangs\n",
    "- ✅ Faster switching between notebooks\n",
    "- ✅ Variables persist across notebooks naturally\n",
    "- ✅ No need for systemd watchers or watcher scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "**If kernel still hangs in JupyterLab (rare):**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pkill -9 -f \"ipykernel_launcher\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then restart the `start_jupyter_lab.sh` script.\n",
    "\n",
